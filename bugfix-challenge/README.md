# Todo List Animation Bugfix Challenge

## Description:

In this coding challenge, you will be tasked with fixing a bug in a todo list application. The bug causes incorrect todo items to be animated when a todo is deleted.

## Challenge Overview:

The provided codebase contains a basic todo list application. The application allows users to add, edit, and delete todo items. When a user deletes a todo item, the animation that plays is not correctly synchronized with the deleted item, resulting in a visual glitch where the wrong item appears to be animated.

## Bug Description:

When a todo item is deleted, the animation trigger is not properly associated with the corresponding todo item, leading to the incorrect item being animated.

## Task:

Your task is to identify and rectify the issue in the code to ensure that the correct todo item is animated when it is deleted.

## Requirements:

- The fix should not introduce new bugs or regressions.
- The UI and overall functionality of the application should not be affected by the fix.

## Deliverables:

- Modified code files with comments explaining the changes made.
- A brief explanation of the approach you took to fix the bug.

## Evaluation Criteria:

- Correctness of the bug fix.
- Clarity and readability of the code.
- Efficiency of the solution.
- Adherence to best practices and coding conventions.

## Additional Information:

You can use any programming language of your choice, and you may also utilize relevant libraries or frameworks if you deem them necessary for the bug fix.

## Note:

Please ensure that your solution is well-documented and easy to understand, as it will be reviewed by the assessors. Additionally, be mindful of potential edge cases that may affect the animation behavior.
